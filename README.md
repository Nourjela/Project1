# Project1

This project is a Java application using JavaFX for the user interface and Maven for dependency management and building.

## Prerequisites

* Java 17 or higher
* Maven 3.6.0 or higher
* An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) is recommended

## Configuration

1.  **Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file at the root of the project.
    * Add the necessary environment variables (e.g., for database connection):

        ```
        DATABASE_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_java
        DATABASE_USER=root
        DATABASE_PASSWORD=root
        ```

2.  **Dependencies:**
    * The `pom.xml` file manages project dependencies, including JavaFX and TestNG.

## Compilation and Execution

1.  **Compilation:**
    ```bash
    mvn compile
    ```

    * To run tests and generate the coverage report:
        ```bash
        mvn verify
        ```

## Javadoc Documentation Generation

* Javadoc documentation is generated from source code comments.
* To generate the documentation, run the following command:

    ```bash
    mvn javadoc:javadoc
    ```

* The generated documentation will be located in the `target/site/apidocs` directory.

## Unit Tests

* Unit tests are written with TestNG.
* To run tests and generate the coverage report, use the command `mvn verify`.
* The test coverage report is generated by JaCoCo.

## Maven Plugins

The project uses the following Maven plugins:

* `maven-surefire-plugin`: To run unit tests.
* `exec-maven-plugin`: To execute the main class of the application.
* `jacoco-maven-plugin`: To generate the test coverage report.
* `maven-checkstyle-plugin`: To verify code style compliance.
* `maven-javadoc-plugin`: To generate Javadoc documentation.
* `javafx-maven-plugin`: To manage JavaFX applications.

## IDE

It is recommended to use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code to facilitate development.
